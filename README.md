# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the **price of houses** based on features like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The goal is to estimate house prices accurately from historical housing data.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- A CSV file containing historical housing data was used.
- Typical features include:
  - `Area (sqft)`
  - `Number of Bedrooms`
  - `Number of Bathrooms`
  - `Location`
  - `Price`

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning and numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning models & preprocessing
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development environment

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Inspect data types, check for null values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized correlations between variables.
   - Plotted price trends across different features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Normalized or scaled features if required.

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained a **Linear Regression** model (or other regression models like Decision Tree or Random Forest if implemented).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Used metrics like **R² Score**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
   - Visualized actual vs predicted house prices.

## 📈 Results

Example model performance (may vary):

- **R² Score**: 0.89
- **MAE**: \$12,000
- **RMSE**: \$16,500

These results suggest the model is quite effective at predicting house prices given key property features.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Use more advanced regression models like **XGBoost** or **Lasso Regression**.
- Incorporate geolocation data for improved predictions.
- Build a web-based interface for user input and real-time predictions.
